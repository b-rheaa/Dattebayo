            <p>This was the first Naruto movie to hit the screens and definitely satisfied the fans. The plot followed
                Team
                7, including Kakashi, Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke on a mission to escort and protect a movie crew with a
                popular actress to the land of snow. During their mission, they encounter a group of ninjas who attack
                the
                crew. Naruto then learns that there is more to the popular actress than meets the eye, which is revealed
                later in the story.

                You can enjoy watching Team 7 take a break from their main storyline and get into a fun action ride. It
                is
                definitely watchable for its fun moments and action scenes, but you won’t miss out on anything if you do
                decide to skip it.</p>

                them are interrupted by a knight, who seems to challenge them. While the story doesn’t give you
                memorable
                moments to remember like the other movies, you can watch our hero battle robotic ninjas to kill time, or
                you
                can just skip it without any regrets.

            <p>The third movie to come out after Legend of the Stone of Gelel (more details below) is Guardians of the
                Crescent Moon Kingdom. Kakashi, Naruto, Sakura, and Rock Lee are assigned on a mission to escort the
                prince

                their country’s minister takes over the country and confronts the prince.

                The team must fight this minister and the powerful ninjas, along with the prince, to help him get his
                country back. As the story sounds a little bland, this movie is not highly recommended by the fans who
                have
                watched it. So you can watch and have mixed feelings about the movie or easily skip it..</p>

            <h2 class="titles">4]Naruto Shippûden: The Movie (2007)</h2>
            <p>This is the first movie in the Shippuden anime series. The storyline of the film sees a group of ninjas
                revive a sealed monster that poses a huge threat to mankind and is capable of destroying the world.
                Naruto
                encounters Princess Shion, the only person in the world capable of sealing the demon back. But things
                start
                to fall apart when Shion predicts his death and asks him to stay away from her. But he decides to change
                his
                fate by protecting her and fighting the demon.

                Though we already know our hero Naruto cannot be killed easily, this story brings in the intriguing
                aspect
                of fate to the story. So, this film keeps you interested throughout and is fun to watch.

            <h2 class="titles">5]Naruto Shippuden: The Movie – Bonds (2008)</h2>
            <p>Naruto Shippuden: The Movie – Bonds is the second movie in the anime series. The Konoha village
                encounters
                another new villain, but this time he’s from the skies. Yes, you heard that right. This group of ninjas,
                known as Sora-nin, are from the Sky Country, and they decided to execute an unexpected revenge attack on
                the
                Leaf village. During the last Shinobi War, Konoha attacked their country and devastated them. And that’s
                the
                reason why they are now back for revenge again on Konoha and the fire nation.

                What’s more interesting about this film is that it takes place when Sasuke is still an ally of
                Orochimaru.
                Yet during this problem, he joins forces with Naruto, and they work together to take the villain down.
                So,
                if you want to witness an alliance between these rivals, you can’t miss out on this movie.</p>

            <h2 class="titles">6] Naruto Shippûden: The Movie 3: Inheritors of the Will of Fire (2009)
            </h2>
            <p>The Will of Fire is a good addition to the Naruto Shippuden movie collection. This film sees ninjas with
                bloodline limits start to disappear one by one across all the countries. While the Fire nation is being
                blamed for this occurrence, Kakashi and his team start to investigate the culprit. Tsunade then sends
                out
                Kakashi on a dangerous mission to defeat the enemy, which involves him sacrificing his own life for
                peace
                between nations.

                When Naruto learns about this deal, he and his friends decide to do everything in order to protect their
                sensei’s life. If you are a huge fan of Naruto and Kakashi’s relationship, you should not miss out on
                this
                film. The sensei and the student’s bond, and their understanding of each other’s emotions are shown
                here.
                The message “Those who abandon their friends are even worse than scum” was taught by Kakashi to his
                team,
                and they certainly follow this in order to save their sensei.</p>

            <p>The fourth movie in the Shippuden series is The Lost Tower. Like the Road to Ninja movie, this also has a
                special storyline, which is a huge treat to the fans. While Naruto was on a hunt to take a criminal
                down, he
                accidentally time travels 20 years into the past. He meets his father before he became the fourth Hokage
                and
                even encounters kid Kakashi. Now, Naruto must capture the criminal and find a way to escape to the
                present.

                You get to see Naruto spend his time with his father, which is the one thing we wanted to see for a long
                time. For that part alone, it is more than worth watching this movie, and it will never fail to
                entertain
                you.</p>

            <p>This is the fifth movie in the Naruto Shippuden movies collection. Naruto gets himself into a terrible
                situation in this film. He is framed for the attempted assassination of the Fourth Raikage. As a result,
                he
                is imprisoned in the Kusagakure’s Houzuki Castle, also known as Blood Prison. This prison is regarded as
                a
                highly secure prison, primarily made for Ninja criminals. To top this worse situation, his chakra is
                sealed
                by the prison’s Warden.

                So, Naruto has to escape from this prison and prove that he was framed without using his powers. This
                interesting plotline is enough for one to get hooked on this movie. It is entertaining to watch Naruto
                get
                involved in a Prison Break-esque situation.</p>

                the Naruto movies are full of action and adventures, but in this movie, we get to see the romantic side
                of
                Naruto and Hinata for the very first time. The story is as follows: After the end of the Fourth Great
                Ninja
                War, Konoha village was able to remain in peace. But that peace did not last long when a new antagonist,
                Toneri Ōtsutsuki showed up and kidnaped Hinata’s younger sister Hanabi. Also, Kakashi notices the moon
                is
                heading toward the earth to cause planetary ruin.

                Naruto now needs to find a way to save Hanabi and save the earth at the same time. Whilst on a serious
                journey to save the world, Naruto and Hinata get along, and their romance blossoms. This movie also has
                crazy action scenes, especially those involving Sasuke. So yeah, it’s a must-watch for you before
                watching
                the finale of the Naruto Shippuden series.</p>

            <h2 class="titles">11] Boruto: Naruto The Movie (2015)
            </h2>
            <p>If you feel sad after finishing the Naruto series, the Boruto film is here to save you once again. This
                film
                takes place right after the finale of the Naruto Shippuden anime series and sets up the foundation for
                the
                next sequel, i.e. Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. As the title suggests, the story focuses on the
                Seventh
                Hokage Naruto’s son Boruto. Just like his dad, Boruto is an energetic kid, and he wants to prove his
                worth
                to his dad by impressing him in the Chunin Exams.

                But they are interrupted by a brand new adversary who decides to destroy the peace and harmony of the
                Konoha
                village (the Hidden Leaf village). Along with Sasuke and Boruto, Naruto now takes charge again to defeat
                this foe. As mentioned earlier, this canon film establishes the base for the future of Naruto and
                Boruto,
                and that’s something a hardcore Naruto fan wouldn’t want to miss. So, Boruto: Naruto The Movie is a
                must-watch.</p>
